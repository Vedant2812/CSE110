I am a senior at UCSD, my friends describe me as:
- > annoyingly outgoing
- > laid back
- > zoned out

If I had to rank my interests outside college, I would say they are:
1. Hiking
2. Cycling
3. Bowling

As a programmer my favorite line of code is '#include' because I love using libraries to make my life easier. I strongly believe that repitition is pointless and see the programming world as one community that should share its resources for the [collective progress](https://www.orfonline.org/expert-speak/tech-collaboration-between-democracies/) of technology.

To contribute I believe I need to:
- [x] Be on track to finish my undergraduate studies in a computer related subject
- [ ] Learn the ins and outs of the tech world and where tech is headed in the near future
- [ ] Assess what role I can play in that vision
